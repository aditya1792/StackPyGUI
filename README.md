Title: Stack GUI with Python and Tkinter

Description:
The "Stack GUI" project is a graphical user interface implementation of a stack data structure using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to perform various stack operations, such as pushing elements onto the stack, popping elements from the stack, peeking at the top element, and displaying the contents of the stack.

The GUI provides an intuitive interface where users can interact with the stack functionalities. It features a visually appealing design with a gradient background, labeled sections for stack display and user input, and buttons for each operation.

Key Features:
1. Push Operation: Users can enter a number and push it onto the stack by clicking the "Push" button. The entered value is added to the top of the stack, and the stack display is updated accordingly.

2. Pop Operation: Clicking the "Pop" button removes the top element from the stack if the stack is not empty. The stack display is updated to reflect the changes.

3. Peek Operation: The "Peek" button allows users to view the top element of the stack without removing it. The top element is displayed as the "PEEK" value.

4. Stack Display: The stack display section shows the current contents of the stack in a visually organized manner. If the stack is empty, an appropriate message is displayed.

5. Attractive Visuals: The GUI incorporates appealing visuals with a gradient background, contrasting color schemes, and styled buttons for an enhanced user experience.

This project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring stack operations through a GUI, allowing users to understand and interact with the stack data structure more effectively.

Note: The project code provided can be further customized and expanded based on specific requirements and preferences.
